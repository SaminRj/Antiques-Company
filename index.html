            This week, after nearly 5 long and hard years, Samin Raja of LJW
            Antiques opens her shop and it's not just any old shop. It is a
            triple fronted shop window building, with accommodation above where
            Samin resides and she has renovated, or should we say, re-built the
            whole thing from top to bottom - or in Samin's case, bottom to top,
            as you will read on her Instagram post which the tab below links to,
            so you can enjoy it yourself. Jane will be visiting this week and
            we'll bring you more, but in the meantime, if you fancy a trip to
            Margate, please do pop in from Friday 14th June and show your
            support and shake the hand of a woman who never gave up on his
            dream.

              Iranian Antiques Company was founded in 1990 by Samin Raja. In
              this company, valuable Iranian goods and antiques are displayed
              and auctioned. The purpose of establishing this company is to give
              importance to the value of Iranian antiques and precious objects
              and to preserve the authentic Iranian culture. This company
              started its work in Isfahan city and in 2006 opened branches in
              Tehran, Shiraz and Tabriz. You can purchase an entry ticket to the
              exhibition by viewing the products on the site. You can also
              register as a buyer so that the date and place of the auction of
              the desired products will be sent to you!
